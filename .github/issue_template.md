### Description
<!-- A quick description of what you're trying to accomplish -->

### Issue

<!--
  What went wrong? (If this issue is a general question or a proposed change,
  feel free to delete this and subsequent sections.
-->

### Environment

- [ ] `node -v` output:
- [ ] `npm -v` (or `yarn --version`) output:
- [ ] `npm ls testdouble` (or `yarn list testdouble`) version:

<!--
  The easier you make it for others to reproduce what you're describing, the
  sooner it will be addressed. If we can't replicate the described behavior, we
  may be forced to close the issue without finding a satisfying resolution.

  Below are four approaches you might take to communicate the issue, in
  descending order of awesomeness. Please choose one and feel free to delete
  the others from this template.
-->

### Failing Test

- [ ] Fork the repo
- [ ] Add a failing test (probably to the `/regression/src' directory)
- [ ] Submit a pull request for the failing test or link to your branch here

### Example Repo

- [ ] Create a minimal repository that reproduces the issue
- [ ] Make sure that a fresh clone can run only `npm it` and observe the issue
- [ ] Link to that repo here

#### Runkit Notebook

- [ ] [Create a Runkit notebook](https://runkit.com/new)
- [ ] Invoke `var td = require('testdouble')` at the top
- [ ] Verify the behavior your issue is concerned with by clicking "Run"
- [ ] Link to the Runkit here

#### Code-fenced Examples

<!--
  If none of the above approaches are feasible or appropriate, you may use
  Markdown code fences like the one below to demonstrate the behavior.

  Please note that issues submitted with only code-fence examples will be
  deprioritized if they prove difficult to reproduce. (That is to say, try to
  be as complete as possible, and use baseline JavaScript that doesn't require
  preprocessing to execute)
-->

```js
var td = require('testdouble')

// Your steps here.
```
