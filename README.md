Welcome! Are you writing JavaScript tests and in the market for a mocking library to
fake out real things for you? testdouble.js is an opinionated, carefully-designed
test double library maintained by, oddly enough, a software agency that's also
named [Test Double](http://testdouble.com).

If you practice test-driven development, testdouble.js was designed to promote
terse, clear, and easy-to-understand tests. There's an awful lot to cover, so
please take some time and enjoy our documentation, which itself is designed to
show you how to make the most out of test doubles in your tests.
